## Overview of Testing in React

### Is testing important?

Testing is an essential part of software development. It helps ensure that your application works as expected and helps prevent future bugs from making it into production. Effective testing can save time, money, and a lot of headaches.

### Types of Tests

In React, we typically focus on three types of tests: Unit tests, Integration tests, and End-to-End tests. Each serves a different purpose and helps catch different kinds of issues.

#### Types of Tests

- Unit Tests: Focus on individual components or functions.
- Integration Tests: Ensure that multiple components work together correctly.
- End-to-End Tests: Simulate real-user interactions from start to finish.

### Testing Tools for React

- **Unit/Integration Testing**:
  - **Jest**: A JavaScript testing framework that works out of the box for React applications.
  - **React Testing Library**: Builds on Jest and helps test components in a way that resembles how they are used by end users.
- **End-to-End Testing**:
  - **Cypress and Playwright**: Tools for running browser-based tests to simulate real user interactions.

### Example of unit test

```js
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
